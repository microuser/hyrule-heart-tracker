## Complete Heart Piece Locations with Detailed Descriptions

### **Heart Piece #1: Kakariko Graveyard - Royal Family's Tomb**
**Requirements**: Sun's Song, Young or Adult Link, Night time  
**Location**: Kakariko Village Graveyard  
Navigate to the back row of the graveyard and locate the Royal Family's Tomb (the large central tombstone). Face away from the tomb toward the exit - you'll see five smaller tombstones on your left. **The second tombstone from the right can be pulled back** to reveal a hidden passage. Drop down into the hole where you'll encounter a ReDead. First, play the Sun's Song to freeze the undead creature, then defeat it with your sword. Once eliminated, stand on the stone platform and play the Sun's Song again - this will cause a treasure chest to materialize containing your first Piece of Heart. This early-game heart piece is accessible as soon as you learn the Sun's Song from the Royal Family's Tomb itself.

### **Heart Piece #2: Kakariko Graveyard - Dampé's Digging Game**
**Requirements**: 10+ Rupees per attempt, Young Link only, Night time (18:00-21:00)  
**Location**: Kakariko Village Graveyard  
Between 6 PM and 9 PM, visit the graveyard to find Dampé the Gravekeeper patrolling the cemetery. Approach him when he's standing near soft soil patches and pay 10 Rupees for his Heart-Pounding Gravedigging Tour. **The heart piece location is completely random**, making this potentially the most expensive heart piece in the game. Dampé will usually find nothing, occasionally discover Rupees, and rarely uncover the heart piece. The optimal strategy is to **ensure Dampé is standing directly on the edge of a dirt pile** before paying, and never ask him to dig the same spot twice consecutively. Budget at least 100-200 Rupees as this can take many attempts. The heart piece will eventually appear - persistence is key.

### **Heart Piece #3: Lon Lon Ranch - Storage Building**
**Requirements**: Young Link, access to Lon Lon Ranch  
**Location**: Lon Lon Ranch storage building  
Enter Lon Lon Ranch and head to the **tall storage building at the back of the ranch** (behind the horse corral). Inside, you'll find several wooden crates stacked in the corner. Push and pull these crates away from the back corner until you reveal a small crawl space in the wall. Crawl through this opening to discover a hidden room containing a Piece of Heart nestled in what appears to be a bird's nest. This is one of the easier heart pieces to obtain early in the game and requires no special items or abilities beyond basic movement.

### **Heart Piece #4: Lost Woods - Skull Kid Musical Challenge**
**Requirements**: Fairy Ocarina, Young Link  
**Location**: Lost Woods, first right from entrance  
Upon entering the Lost Woods from Kokiri Forest, take the **first right turn** and you'll see a raised platform area. Drop down to the lower section using the ladder on the left side. Stand on the tree stump positioned to the right and two Skull Kids will appear before you. Pull out your Fairy Ocarina to initiate their musical memory game. **This functions as a Simon Says challenge** where the Skull Kids will play increasingly complex melodies that you must repeat perfectly. The first round features 3 notes, the second adds a 4th note, and the final round includes 5 notes. Successfully complete all three rounds without error to earn the Piece of Heart. Listen carefully and consider humming or writing down the note sequence if needed.

### **Heart Piece #5: Lost Woods - Saria's Song Friendship**
**Requirements**: Saria's Song, Young Link  
**Location**: Lost Woods, first left from entrance  
From the Lost Woods entrance, take the **first left turn** and you'll find a single Skull Kid with a flute standing on a tree stump. Position yourself on the opposite stump and pull out your Ocarina. Play Saria's Song (the melody you learned from Saria in the Sacred Forest Meadow) for the lonely Skull Kid. Moved by the beautiful song that reminds him of his forest friend, the Skull Kid will recognize you as a kindred spirit and reward you with a Piece of Heart. This touching moment represents the power of music to forge friendships across different species in the Zelda universe.

### **Heart Piece #6: Hyrule Market - Lost Dog Return**
**Requirements**: Young Link, Night time  
**Location**: Hyrule Castle Town Market  
Wait until nightfall and enter the Market from Hyrule Field. Look for a **white dog wandering near the empty stall** in the corner of the market area, specifically near the entrance. Approach the dog and simply touch it - it will begin following you automatically. Navigate to the back alley area (toward where the Bombchu Bowling Alley will later be) and find the **only open door at night** - this leads to a small house. Inside, you'll discover Mamamu Yan, a woman who has been desperately searching for her beloved pet "Little Richard" during the day. She'll be overjoyed at the dog's return and reward you with a Piece of Heart for your kindness. This quest showcases the importance of helping others and the bonds between people and their animal companions.

### **Heart Piece #7: Goron City - Spinning Urn Challenge**
**Requirements**: Young Link, Goron's Bracelet, access to Darunia's chamber  
**Location**: Goron City lower level  
This challenging mini-game requires precise timing and patience. First, light a Deku Stick from the eternal flame in Darunia's chamber on the upper level. **Quickly run around the lower level lighting all the torches** before your stick burns out - there are several torches positioned around the curved walkways. If your stick gets too short, store it and take it out again to refresh it. Once all torches are lit, the massive Goron-faced urn in the center will begin spinning. Head to the second floor and **wait for the urn to rotate so the smiling face points toward you**, then throw a Bomb Flower or regular Bomb into the opening. If the bomb explodes while the happy face is visible, you'll receive a Piece of Heart and 25 Rupees. This timing-based challenge can be frustrating but is rewarding when mastered.

### **Heart Piece #8: Death Mountain Trail - Above Dodongo's Cavern**
**Requirements**: Young Link (backflip method) or Adult Link (Magic Bean method)  
**Location**: Ledge above Dodongo's Cavern entrance  
Two methods exist for this tricky heart piece. **As Young Link**: Pick up the Bomb Flower near the cavern entrance and throw it away from the entrance. Position yourself between the Bomb Flower spawn point and the shorter section of fence, with your back to the fence but turned slightly right. Lock onto the Goron next to the Bomb Flower location, then perform a backflip (hold Z + back + A). If executed correctly, you'll land on the hidden ledge above the cavern. **As Adult Link**: Plant a Magic Bean in the soft soil patch as a child (costs 60 Rupees), then return as an adult and ride the bean platform to easily reach the ledge. The backflip method requires precise positioning but allows early collection of this heart piece.

### **Heart Piece #9: Kakariko Village - Impa's House Rooftop**
**Requirements**: Owl ride from Death Mountain (Young Link) or Hookshot (Adult Link)  
**Location**: Inside Impa's house via rooftop entrance  
After obtaining the Bomb Bag, climb to the top of Death Mountain Trail where you'll find Kaepora Gaebora the owl. Speak with him and accept his offer for a ride back to Kakariko Village. **He'll deposit you on top of Impa's house** (the building in the southwest corner). Don't jump down immediately - instead, walk to the right side of the roof where you'll notice a ledge above the Cucco pen area. Drop down onto this ledge and enter the small hole in the wall. Inside, you'll find yourself in a cage within Impa's house, accompanied by a cow and a Piece of Heart. As Adult Link, you can reach this same location using the Hookshot to scale buildings and access the rooftop entrance.

### **Heart Piece #10: Death Mountain Crater - Alcove Heart**
**Requirements**: Young Link (timed dash) or Adult Link with Goron Tunic  
**Location**: Death Mountain Crater climbable wall alcove  
Enter Death Mountain Crater from the top of Death Mountain Trail. As Young Link, you have limited time before the extreme heat forces you out. **Run straight forward to the climbable wall and rapidly climb down** to the alcove containing the heart piece, then quickly drop down to return to the entrance before the timer expires. Your health determines how long you can survive - more heart containers mean more time. As Adult Link with the Goron Tunic, you can explore at leisure and easily reach the alcove. Alternatively, plant a Magic Bean at the crater base as a child and ride it as an adult to reach the alcove safely.

### **Heart Piece #11: Hyrule Market - Bombchu Bowling Prize**
**Requirements**: Young Link, completion of Dodongo's Cavern, 30 Rupees per game  
**Location**: Bombchu Bowling Alley (day only)  
The Bombchu Bowling Alley opens after completing Dodongo's Cavern and operates only during daytime hours. **The prize rotation follows a specific cycle**: Bombchus → Heart Piece → Bombs → Bomb Bag → Purple Rupee (50 Rupees) → repeat. To win the heart piece, you must hit all three targets with your Bombchus in a single game. The challenge requires understanding Bombchu movement - they travel in straight lines but can climb walls and navigate obstacles. **If you win but don't get the heart piece, you must wait for the prize cycle to rotate** back to it. The alley's dim lighting makes targeting more difficult, but the Bombchus' glowing trail helps track their path.

### **Heart Piece #12: Hyrule Field - Hidden Business Scrub**
**Requirements**: Bombs, 10 Rupees, Shard/Stone of Agony helpful  
**Location**: Fenced area near Lake Hylia entrance  
At the southwestern edge of Hyrule Field, near the entrance to Lake Hylia, you'll find a **small square area enclosed by four fence posts**. If you have the Shard of Agony (from collecting 40 Gold Skulltula tokens), it will activate near this location. Place a bomb in the exact center of the fenced area and it will reveal a hidden grotto. Drop down to find a Business Scrub who initially attacks with nuts. **Deflect one of his nuts back at him** with your shield to make him friendly, then purchase his Piece of Heart for 10 Rupees. This represents one of the most affordable direct-purchase heart pieces in the game.

### **Heart Piece #13: Zora's River - Central Pillar**
**Requirements**: Various methods available  
**Location**: Stone pillar in central Zora's River  
A Piece of Heart sits atop a tall stone pillar in the middle of Zora's River. **Multiple collection methods exist**: As Young Link, carry the Cucco from the river entrance all the way to the pillar area, jump toward the pillar, and throw the Cucco at the last moment to grab the ledge. With the Boomerang, you can retrieve it from a distance. As Adult Link, the Hover Boots allow you to float across the gap. The Cucco method requires patience as you must protect the bird from water (which makes it fly away) while navigating the river's platforms and avoiding Octorok attacks.

### **Heart Piece #14: Zora's River - Upper Platform**
**Requirements**: Cucco transport, Boomerang, or Hover Boots  
**Location**: Platform near Zora's Domain entrance  
Near the waterfall entrance to Zora's Domain, a Piece of Heart rests on a high platform. **The Cucco method involves careful navigation** - carry the bird from the river entrance, throwing it onto higher ledges and quickly recapturing it before it touches water. When you reach the highest accessible point near the platform, make a running jump toward it and release the Cucco at the optimal moment to grab the platform edge. Alternatively, the Boomerang can retrieve this heart piece from below, while Adult Link can use Hover Boots to float across. The platform's position makes it visible but challenging to reach without proper equipment.

### **Heart Piece #15: Zora's Domain - Five Torch Challenge**
**Requirements**: Young Link, Deku Sticks  
**Location**: Behind Zora's Domain waterfall  
This timed challenge requires lighting five torches throughout Zora's Domain in sequence. **Begin by lighting a Deku Stick from the eternal flame in King Zora's chamber**. The five torch locations are: 1) Bottom of the stairs leading to the throne room, 2) Near the Zora shop, 3) Next to the stone circle in the shallow water area, 4) Behind the waterfall (first torch), and 5) Behind the waterfall (second torch). **Speed is essential** - stay in shallow water when possible as swimming extinguishes your stick. If your stick burns too low, store it and retrieve it to refresh the flame. Successfully lighting all five torches within the time limit causes a chest to appear behind the waterfall containing the Piece of Heart.

### **Heart Piece #16: Lake Hylia - Fishing Champion**
**Requirements**: Young Link, 20 Rupees, fishing skill  
**Location**: Fishing Pond  
Visit the Fishing Pond and pay 20 Rupees to rent a fishing rod. **Your goal is to catch a fish weighing 10 pounds or more**. The largest fish typically lurk near the log in the pond's center or among the reeds along the edges. **Optimal fishing times include sunrise and sunset** when fish are more active. Cast near structures where fish gather, and use patience - don't reel in immediately when you get a bite. Let the fish tire itself by fighting against the line, then slowly reel it in when it stops struggling. Present your record catch to the Fishing Hole Man, and if it weighs 10+ pounds, he'll reward you with a Piece of Heart celebrating your angling prowess.

### **Heart Piece #17: Gerudo Valley - Waterfall Alcove**
**Requirements**: None (multiple access methods)  
**Location**: Hidden alcove behind the waterfall  
Behind Gerudo Valley's impressive waterfall lies a secret alcove containing a Piece of Heart. **As Young Link, grab the Cucco** wandering near the bridge and use it to fly directly behind the waterfall where you'll find a ladder leading up to the alcove. As Adult Link without a Cucco, jump down to the river level and swim to the ladder behind the waterfall. The water current is strong, so approach from the side rather than fighting it directly. This heart piece showcases how the same location can be accessed through different methods depending on your available tools and Link's age.

### **Heart Piece #18: Gerudo Valley - Platform Crate**
**Requirements**: Cucco (Young Link) or Longshot (Adult Link)  
**Location**: Wooden crate on distant platform  
From Gerudo Valley's bridge, look toward the left (Hyrule Field side) to spot a platform against the canyon wall with a wooden crate. **As Young Link, carry the Cucco** to the bridge's edge and fly across the gap to reach the platform. **Roll into the crate to break it** and reveal the hidden Piece of Heart. As Adult Link, you can jump down to the lower platform on the same side and use the Longshot to target the crate directly, pulling yourself across the gap. This demonstrates how Adult Link's advanced equipment can provide alternative solutions to challenges originally designed for Young Link's abilities.

### **Heart Piece #19: Kakariko Graveyard - Magic Bean Platform**
**Requirements**: Adult Link, Magic Bean planted as child  
**Location**: High ledge accessible via bean platform  
**As Young Link, plant a Magic Bean** in the soft soil patch on the left side of Kakariko Graveyard (costs 70 Rupees). Return as Adult Link to find a fully grown bean platform. Ride it to the upper ledge where you'll find a wooden crate. Roll into the crate to break it and claim the Piece of Heart inside. This represents one of the most expensive heart pieces due to the Magic Bean cost, but it's guaranteed once you've made the investment. The bean platforms provide access to numerous elevated areas throughout Hyrule that are otherwise unreachable.

### **Heart Piece #20: Kakariko Village - Windmill Platform**
**Requirements**: Boomerang (Young Link) or completion of Dampé's ghost race (Adult Link)  
**Location**: Upper platform inside the windmill  
Two paths lead to this elevated heart piece. **As Young Link with the Boomerang**, you can retrieve the heart piece from below without climbing. As Adult Link, you must first complete Dampé's ghost race in his crypt (which requires the Hookshot), emerging through the windmill. This provides access to the moving platforms inside the windmill. **Carefully time your jumps across the rotating wooden beams** to reach the upper platform where the Piece of Heart awaits. The windmill's mechanics create a dynamic platforming challenge that tests your timing and spatial awareness.

### **Heart Piece #21: Dampé's Ghost Race - Under One Minute**
**Requirements**: Adult Link, Hookshot, racing skill  
**Location**: Reward for completing Dampé's ghost race quickly  
After obtaining the Hookshot from your first race against Dampé's ghost, you can challenge him again for a speed run. **Complete the race in under 60 seconds to earn this heart piece**. The key strategy involves taking optimal racing lines through the maze-like crypt, rolling frequently to maintain speed, and using the **Longshot on the torch in the second-to-last room** to skip the final corner and catch Dampé before time expires. Even without the Longshot, skilled players can achieve the time requirement through efficient movement and route memorization. This challenge rewards players who master the game's movement mechanics.

### **Heart Piece #22: Kakariko Village - Rooftop Conversation**
**Requirements**: Adult Link, Hookshot/Longshot  
**Location**: Top of Granny's Potion Shop  
**Use your Hookshot to reach the roof of Granny's Potion Shop** (the building near the windmill where the old woman sells potions during the day). Once on the rooftop, you'll find a man standing there who will give you a Piece of Heart simply for making the effort to visit him. As Young Link, this can be achieved through creative jumping from the lookout tower - face south, target, and side-jump left to land on the fence, then climb to the roof. This heart piece rewards exploration and the use of advanced movement techniques to reach seemingly inaccessible areas.

### **Heart Piece #23: House of Skulltula - 50 Gold Skulltula Reward**
**Requirements**: 50 Gold Skulltula Tokens  
**Location**: House of Skulltula, Kakariko Village  
The cursed family in Kakariko Village's House of Skulltula offers this heart piece as their gratitude for collecting **50 Gold Skulltula Tokens**. This represents a significant collection challenge as Gold Skulltulas are scattered throughout Hyrule, hidden in trees, buildings, and secret locations. Many require specific times (night for most) or special equipment to reach. **The reward progression includes**: 10 tokens (Adult's Wallet), 20 tokens (Stone of Agony), 30 tokens (Giant's Wallet), 40 tokens (10 Bombchus), and finally 50 tokens (Piece of Heart). This long-term collection quest encourages thorough exploration of every area in the game.

### **Heart Piece #24: Lake Hylia Laboratory - Rooftop**
**Requirements**: Adult Link, Magic Bean or Scarecrow's Song + Hookshot  
**Location**: Top of Lakeside Laboratory  
**Plant a Magic Bean** at Lake Hylia as Young Link (costs 80 Rupees), then return as Adult Link to ride the bean platform to the laboratory's roof. Alternatively, teach the Scarecrow's Song to Bonooru as Young Link, then as Adult Link, play the song near the laboratory to summon Pierre the scarecrow and use your Hookshot to reach him. Once atop the building, climb the ladder to claim the Piece of Heart. Watch out for Guay (crow-like enemies) that may attack while you're on the roof. This location demonstrates how multiple solutions can achieve the same goal using different equipment sets.

### **Heart Piece #25: Lake Hylia Laboratory - Deep Dive**
**Requirements**: Golden Scale from fishing pond  
**Location**: Bottom of laboratory's water tank  
After earning the Golden Scale by catching a 10+ pound fish at the fishing pond, visit the Lakeside Laboratory and **dive to the very bottom of the water-filled tank inside the building**. When you reach the bottom, you'll hear the distinctive "secret discovery" chime. Surface and speak with the Lake Scientist, who will be impressed by your diving ability and reward you with a Piece of Heart. This connection between the fishing mini-game and the laboratory creates a logical progression where mastering one skill (fishing) unlocks access to another area's treasure.

### **Heart Piece #26: Hyrule Field - Hidden Tree Grotto**
**Requirements**: Stone/Shard of Agony, Golden Scale or Iron Boots, Bombs  
**Location**: Underwater in secret grotto northwest of Lon Lon Ranch  
**Use the Stone/Shard of Agony to locate the specific tree** in Hyrule Field that conceals this hidden grotto - it's positioned northwest of Lon Lon Ranch, between Gerudo Valley and Hyrule Castle. When your agony sensor activates, bomb the tree to reveal a hidden entrance. Drop down into the grotto where you'll find a pool of water. **Use either the Golden Scale or Iron Boots to dive to the bottom** and retrieve the Piece of Heart. This represents one of the most hidden heart pieces in the game, requiring both detection equipment and diving capability to access.

### **Heart Piece #27: Death Mountain Trail - Magic Bean Flight**
**Requirements**: Adult Link, Magic Bean planted as child at Dodongo's Cavern  
**Location**: High ledge above Dodongo's Cavern  
**Plant a Magic Bean in the soft soil directly in front of Dodongo's Cavern entrance** as Young Link (costs 60 Rupees). Return as Adult Link to find the bean has grown into a platform that will carry you on a flight path around the Death Mountain area. **Ride the platform up to the high ledge above the cavern entrance** where the Piece of Heart awaits. This method is much safer than the tricky backflip technique required to reach this location as Young Link, demonstrating how Adult Link's access to grown Magic Beans provides elegant solutions to earlier challenges.

### **Heart Piece #28: Death Mountain Crater - Smoking Pillar**
**Requirements**: Adult Link, Bolero of Fire, Magic Bean planted as child  
**Location**: Top of volcanic pillar in crater center  
As Young Link, warp to Death Mountain Crater using the Bolero of Fire and **plant a Magic Bean in the soft soil next to the Triforce pedestal** (costs 90 Rupees). Return as Adult Link and ride the bean platform, which will take you on an aerial tour of the crater, eventually reaching the top of one of the smoking volcanic pillars in the crater's center. **Jump off the platform when it passes over the pillar** to claim the Piece of Heart at its peak. The timing requires attention as the platform continues moving, and the volcanic environment adds atmospheric tension to this high-altitude collection.

### **Heart Piece #29: Zora's Fountain - Iceberg Platform**
**Requirements**: Adult Link  
**Location**: Floating iceberg in frozen Zora's Fountain  
When you return to Zora's Fountain as Adult Link, you'll discover that Lord Jabu-Jabu has vanished and the entire area has frozen over, creating a field of floating icebergs. **Navigate carefully across these icy platforms** by jumping from iceberg to iceberg until you locate the one containing the Piece of Heart. The icebergs have different sizes and heights, requiring strategic planning for your jumping route. Some icebergs may be slippery or unstable, making this a test of your platforming skills in a dramatically transformed environment that reflects the world's corruption during Adult Link's era.

### **Heart Piece #30: Ice Cavern - Red Ice Prison**
**Requirements**: Adult Link, Blue Fire in bottle  
**Location**: Ice Cavern compass room  
In the Ice Cavern's compass room (the far right chamber), you'll encounter several patches of red ice that cannot be melted by normal fire. **Collect Blue Fire in an empty bottle** from one of the special torches within the cavern, then use it to melt the red ice blocks. One of these frozen formations contains a Piece of Heart. The room also features falling stalactites that can damage you, so move carefully while searching for the correct ice formation to melt. This heart piece emphasizes the Ice Cavern's unique mechanics and the importance of understanding how different fire types interact with various ice formations.

### **Heart Piece #31: Zora's Fountain - Lake Floor**
**Requirements**: Adult Link, Iron Boots, Zora Tunic recommended  
**Location**: Bottom of Zora's Fountain  
Equip the Iron Boots to sink to the very bottom of the frozen Zora's Fountain. **The Zora Tunic is highly recommended** as it allows unlimited underwater breathing, though the heart piece can be collected without it if you're quick. The piece rests on the lake floor in the deepest part of the fountain. Navigate carefully around the underwater terrain and any remaining ice formations to locate and collect this submerged treasure. This heart piece showcases how Adult Link's advanced equipment enables exploration of areas completely inaccessible to Young Link.

### **Heart Piece #32: Zora's River - Song of Storms Frogs**
**Requirements**: Young Link, Song of Storms  
**Location**: Frog congregation at fallen log in Zora's River  
Navigate to the fallen log that extends into the water in central Zora's River. **Stand on the log's edge and pull out your Ocarina** - five frogs will emerge from the water to listen to your music. Play the Song of Storms, and the frogs will be so delighted by the melody that they'll reward you with a Piece of Heart. This heart piece requires learning the Song of Storms from the Windmill Man in Kakariko Village, which can only be accomplished after creating a time paradox by teaching him the song as Adult Link, then returning as Young Link when he already knows it.

### **Heart Piece #33: Zora's River - Frog Orchestra Bug Game**
**Requirements**: Young Link, all five non-warp songs learned  
**Location**: Same frog location in Zora's River  
After obtaining the Song of Storms heart piece, return to the same log and **play all five of the regular Ocarina songs** for the frogs: Zelda's Lullaby, Saria's Song, Epona's Song, Sun's Song, and Song of Time. Each song will cause one frog to grow larger. Once all five frogs have grown into the "Fabulous Five Froggish Tenors," they'll challenge you to a bug-catching rhythm game. **Follow the precise button sequence**: A, C-left, C-right, C-down, C-left, C-right, C-down, A, C-down, A, C-down, C-right, C-left, A (N64 version). Successfully complete this challenging mini-game to earn another Piece of Heart from your amphibious audience.

### **Heart Piece #34: Hyrule Market - Treasure Chest Game**
**Requirements**: Young Link, night time, Lens of Truth highly recommended  
**Location**: Treasure Chest Shop (night only)  
**The Treasure Chest Game operates only during nighttime hours** and costs 10 Rupees per attempt. You must successfully choose the correct chest in five consecutive rooms to win the heart piece. Each room offers two chests - one contains the key to proceed, while the other resets your progress. **Without the Lens of Truth, this is essentially gambling** with poor odds (1/32 chance of success). With the Lens of Truth from the Bottom of the Well, you can see through the chests to identify which contains the key, making victory guaranteed but still requiring the investment of time and the 10 rupee entry fee.

### **Heart Piece #35: Gerudo's Fortress - Rooftop Treasure**
**Requirements**: Adult Link, Gerudo Token, Longshot or Scarecrow's Song + Hookshot  
**Location**: Chest on the highest point of Gerudo's Fortress  
After rescuing all the carpenters and earning your Gerudo Token, **navigate to the highest accessible point of the fortress**. Use one of the southern doors to reach an upper ledge, then climb vines to reach the fortress's peak. At the gap near the north side, either play the Scarecrow's Song to summon Pierre and hookshot to him, or use the Longshot to directly target the large treasure chest. The chest contains a Piece of Heart, representing one of the most challenging heart pieces to reach due to its remote location and the complex navigation required through the fortress's multi-level structure.

### **Heart Piece #36: Horseback Archery Range - Master Archer**
**Requirements**: Adult Link, Gerudo Token, Epona, archery skill  
**Location**: Gerudo's Fortress Horseback Archery Range  
With your Gerudo Token and Epona, **access the Horseback Archery Range east of the fortress**. This challenging mini-game requires scoring 1,000+ points with 20 arrows while riding Epona at full gallop. **Scoring system**: Bullseyes and pot targets award 100 points, while other hits provide proportional scores based on accuracy. The targets include both stationary and moving objects, requiring prediction of Epona's movement and your arrow's flight path. **Achieving 1,500+ points earns the Biggest Quiver upgrade**, making this range valuable for multiple rewards. This represents the ultimate test of mounted archery skills and precision timing.

### **Heart Piece #37: Desert Colossus - Final Magic Bean Flight**
**Requirements**: Adult Link, Requiem of Spirit, Magic Bean planted as child  
**Location**: Stone arch platform near Spirit Temple  
**Plant a Magic Bean in the soft soil near the Spirit Temple entrance** as Young Link (costs 100 Rupees - the most expensive bean). Use the Requiem of Spirit to warp there efficiently. Return as Adult Link and ride the final Magic Bean platform, which will carry you on an aerial journey around the Desert Colossus area. **Near the end of the platform's flight path, it will pass over the distinctive stone arch formation** where the final Piece of Heart in the game awaits. Jump off at the precise moment to collect this ultimate treasure, completing your set of all 36 heart pieces and maximizing Link's health for the final confrontation with Ganon.
